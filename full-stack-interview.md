## 1.What is the difference between Socket.io and HTTPS?

## When to use Socket.IO
Socket.IO is ideal for building any app that involves an exchange of messages between multiple users and a server, where you want to maintain the overall state and want a responsive bi-directional realtime user experience. Examples include chat/messenger apps, multi-user games, collaborative editing (think Google Docs), location-based apps, and more.

Socket.IO has good cross-browser compatibility, but its support for different platforms (i.e. non-JavaScript/Node.js) can be patchy. If you are using a well-supported client/server combination, and you are not concerned about supporting legacy browsers, then Socket.IO is fine. If you need an alternative, read our Socket.IO alternatives article for options.

## When to use HTTP
HTTP is ideal for multi-user apps where you don’t need realtime responsiveness in two directions, but you are still concerned with reliable, secure data exchanges between each client and the server. Think about traditional REST/CRUD apps — banking apps, email apps, weather apps, and e-commerce apps.

HTTP is a very mature technology with great support across web browsers, server platforms, and non-browser client types. If you are concerned about patchy support for a library such as Socket.IO, consider building your app using raw HTTP.


## 2.JavaScript vs. TypeScript: A Comparative Overview

JavaScript and TypeScript are closely related programming languages, but they have some key differences:   

## JavaScript:

Dynamically Typed: Variable types are determined at runtime, which can lead to potential type-related errors.   
No Compilation Step: Code is interpreted directly by the browser.
Flexible Syntax: Offers a more flexible and less structured approach to coding.

## TypeScript:
Statically Typed: Variable types are declared explicitly, allowing for early error detection and improved code reliability.   
Compilation Step: Code is compiled into JavaScript before execution.   
Stronger Type System: Provides features like interfaces, classes, and modules for better code organization and maintainability.
